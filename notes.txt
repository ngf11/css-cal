the cal() fucntion allows us to do addition multiplication and devicion in an length unit togther wiht each other in order to get  an output result
Example: calc(100px + 200px) // this is 300 px 

we can also nest tese with each other calc(400px - calc(100px + 200px)). this 100px

one think to know about calc is that you can conbiend difernten units
Example: px rem fr
calc(100% - 30px)
this is where the magic of calc() comes in the ability to combine different units with each other

This allows you to use margin with out using margin.
noq we can use margin to center things 
 width: calc(100% - 30px);
  margin: 0 auto;
  this will take 30pxs and split them in both sides

  Where clac really shines is is when you start using css variables
  --width: 100px
  width: calc(var(--width ) * 2);
  200px with

  one instent where this is very useful is when using colors.
  for example if we are working with colors in this case hsl(hue, saturation lightness)
  if we set a varibale for hue in root: --hue:180
we can use the calc to get oppiset colors 
background:hsl(var(--hue),100%,50%) light blue
background:hsl(ca(var(--hue)-180), 100%, 50%) red. oppiset of light blue

we can change the hue and we will always get complemtery colors
